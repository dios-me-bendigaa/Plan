### Optional Review Weeks (13-15)

If you have extra time or need a refresher, use weeks 13-15 to revisit each technology. Set up a mini-project where you automate deployment and monitoring of an AWS environment using **Python and Ansible**, then use **Datadog**


To make steady progress with your learning while balancing your work schedule, you can break down your daily routine into manageable chunks. Here's a **structured yet flexible daily schedule** to learn **AWS, Python, and Ansible**. Since you're working five days a week, we'll aim for around **45 minutes to 1 hour per day**, with additional time on weekends for reviews or hands-on projects.

### Daily Schedule Breakdown

#### **General Structure**
- **Daily Commitment**: 45 minutes to 1 hour
- **Days**: Monday to Friday
- **Weekend** (optional): 1-2 hours for deeper practice, reviewing concepts, or tackling mini-projects.

Each day will focus on one subject, but we’ll rotate between AWS, Python, and Ansible to keep things fresh and prevent burnout. You can adjust this schedule based on your energy levels, but sticking to this rhythm will help you cover all key areas without overwhelming you.

---

### **Weekly Focus**
- **Monday, Wednesday, Friday**: Focus on **AWS**
- **Tuesday, Thursday**: Focus on **Python** and **Ansible** (alternating between the two)
- **Weekend** (optional): Review, practice, or work on mini-projects.

---

### **Detailed Daily Schedule**

#### **Monday (AWS)**
- **45 min - 1 hour**
  - **Topic**: Core AWS Service (e.g., IAM, EC2, or S3)
  - **Activities**:
    - **Study**: Read through the AWS documentation or course material for the selected topic.
    - **Hands-on**: Log into AWS, explore the service, and perform a task related to the topic (e.g., creating an EC2 instance, configuring an S3 bucket).
  - **Motivation Tip**: Visualizing the task you’re doing in real-world scenarios (e.g., "I’m setting up an EC2 instance for a website") makes it feel more impactful.

#### **Tuesday (Python)**
- **45 min - 1 hour**
  - **Topic**: Python Basics (e.g., syntax, data types, functions)
  - **Activities**:
    - **Study**: Watch a lesson or read through Python documentation for the specific topic.
    - **Practice**: Write small scripts to practice. Example: Write a script that takes user input and prints it in a specific format.
    - **Small Task**: Try to solve a small coding problem on websites like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) or [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).
  - **Motivation Tip**: Start small, then gradually increase the complexity of your exercises. Track your progress by solving small, achievable problems.

#### **Wednesday (AWS)**
- **45 min - 1 hour**
  - **Topic**: Advanced AWS Concepts (e.g., VPC, EC2 Scaling, Load Balancers)
  - **Activities**:
    - **Study**: Continue learning from AWS documentation or a course (e.g., AWS Certified Solutions Architect).
    - **Hands-on**: Implement what you’ve learned by creating and configuring services in the AWS Console (e.g., setting up a VPC and subnets).
  - **Motivation Tip**: Think of the long-term benefits of mastering AWS, like building scalable infrastructure and automating deployments.

#### **Thursday (Ansible)**
- **45 min - 1 hour**
  - **Topic**: Ansible Basics (e.g., Introduction to Playbooks, Writing First Playbook)
  - **Activities**:

    - **Practice**: Write functions that manipulate data structures, e.g., creating a function that sorts a list of numbers.
    - **Small Project**: Try writing a simple script that uses multiple functions.
  - **Motivation Tip**: Writing your own code from scratch is the most satisfying part. Keep pushing yourself to solve bigger problems!

#### **Weekend (Optional) – Review, Practice, or Project**
- **1-2 hours**
  - **Topic**: Review the week's material and reinforce learning.
  - **Activities**:
    - **AWS**: Revisit services you’ve worked with during the week. Try creating a full-stack setup (EC2 + RDS + S3).
    - **Python**: Build a small automation script or a data processing script.
    - **Ansible**: Write an Ansible playbook to configure a service across multiple EC2 instances or a remote system.
    - **Project Work**: Try integrating multiple tools (e.g., use Python to automate AWS deployments using boto3 and manage configurations with Ansible).
  
- **Motivation Tip**: Weekend work can be a chance to apply everything you’ve learned during the week in a practical project. It’ll help cement your knowledge.

### **Additional Strategies to Keep You On Track**
1. **Use a Learning Journal**: Document your progress daily. Write down what you learned, what worked well, and where you had trouble. This will help you track your growth.
2. **Stay Consistent**: Even on busy days, try to stick to your 45-minute to 1-hour commitment. Consistency is key.
3. **Join a Community**: Engage in online communities like Stack Overflow, Reddit, or the official Ansible and Python forums to stay motivated and get help when needed.
4. **Use "The Pomodoro Technique"**: For particularly tough topics, break your learning into 25-minute blocks with 5-minute breaks in between. This keeps your mind fresh and focused.
5. **Set Achievable Milestones**: For example, by the end of week 4, you should have a basic AWS setup running, a simple Python script automation, and at least one Ansible playbook working. Celebrating small wins keeps you motivated.

### **Motivation Tips**
1. **Focus on the “Why”**: Remind yourself why each technology is important. AWS helps with cloud scalability, Python powers automation, and Ansible makes your infrastructure more efficient.
2. **Reward Yourself**: After completing each week's goal, reward yourself with something small—whether it's a break, a snack, or something you enjoy.
3. **Track Progress**: Use tools like Trello or Notion to track what you've learned and where you're headed. Each completed task or lesson is progress!

By consistently following this schedule, you will be able to learn AWS, Python, and Ansible deeply over time while balancing your day-to-day work. Stay disciplined, but also give yourself space to enjoy the learning process. 🌟
